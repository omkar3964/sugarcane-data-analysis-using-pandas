Sugarcane Data Analysis using Pandas

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on global sugarcane production dataset to uncover trends, top producers, and continent-wise insights.

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing global sugarcane production data using Python
Through data cleaning, univariate & bivariate analysis, and visualizations, the project highlights:
Top producing countries
Continent-wise production comparison
Correlation between land area, yield, and production

Dataset
Source: List of Countries by Sugarcane Production (CSV file)

Features:

Country
Continent
Production (in tons)
Land Area (acreage)
Yield per hectare

Technologies Used

Python 
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Key Insights

Identified the Top 10 countries in sugarcane production, acreage, and yield.
Analyzed continent-wise production trends.
Found correlations between land area, yield, and total production.
Showed how number of producing countries per continent affects overall production.
